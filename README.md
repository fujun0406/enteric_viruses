## Overview
Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have a significant influence on public health and economy [Jones et al. 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06536). Vietnam has experienced a number of emerging diseases outbreaks which cause by zoonotic pathogens. The Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (VIZIONs) project aim to understand the nature, public health and the origins of infectious disease cases. The enteric viruses study is part of components. In this project, 
* Based on the number of infected viruses to classify patients into three groups, including no viruses, single virus and multiple viruses.
* Using Bayesian mixed effects logistic regression model to investigate the risk factors for infection group.
* Using logistic regression to detect the impact between single virus infection and multiple viruses infection.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In the VIZIONS, the enteric disease study took place in several hospitals between 2012 and 2015 in Vietnam ([Rabaa et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26403795/)).
